        "```python\nclass Agent:\n    def __init__(self, model, tools):\n        self.model = model\n        self.tools = tools\n        self.memory = []\n\n    def run(self, task):\n        print(f'Starting task: {task}')\n        while True:\n            # 1.

        "With this simple loop, the agent is able to execute multi-step reasoning, run tools to interact with the external environment, and self-correct when errors occur.
